Hello guys

This is my first official framework

This framework is ready to use.
Just download and move to /htdocs or /www then visit /monkimvc

Default controller is /monkimvc/home/index


Executed files:

index.php
Bootstrap.php



Features:
Support the ZF namespace structure

ex: 
Auth_Model (/models/Auth/Model.php)


Future Plan
- include base template - getskeleton.com
- js/css rendering per controller
- layout selection - just like on zf



Why monkimvc?
Well, monki(monkey) is the name of my gf's stufftoy :D
